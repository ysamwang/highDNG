- Dlingam.m: DirectLiNGAM algorithm
This requires iperm.m, ols.m and tridecomp.m. 
Also need to download some codes (See the help of Dlingam.m)

- plotsDlingam: Draws scatterplots to visualize estimation results
This requires Dlingam.m
Also requries binornd.m of Matlab statistics toolbox


- Dlingamboot.m: Do bootsrapping to find significant directed edges (direct causal effects) bij and total causal effects aij. 
This requires estA.m

- testDlingamboot.m: a very simple code to test Dlingamboot.m

- adalassopruning.m: Prune redundant directed edges using Adaptive Lasso
This requires adalasso.m.  
Also requires regress.m and lasso.m of Matlab statistics toolbox

- testadalassopruning.m: a very simple code to test adalassopruning.m
